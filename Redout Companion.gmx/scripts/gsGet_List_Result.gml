/*
When your high score list arrives in your game it will be a single long string delimited with bars (|) and commas (,).
The bars separate the records, the commas separate the name and score in an individual record. So your high score list will 
arrive something like this:

Player1,1200|player2,1189|player3,1065|player4,1030|… and so on. 

This makes it easy to send in one call, but it’s useless to use in the game, so we will have to break it up!
This script will break your list up and store it all in a ds_list with 20 records, the name and scores of your top 10 players. 
It will be organized name, score, name, score etc. like this:
Player1
1200
Player2
1189
Player3
1065
Making the individual records in a ds_list will allow you to build your high score table any way you please to match your game!
