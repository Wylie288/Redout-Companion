global.trackDescription[0] = "Calima is quite fast and basic, and that is why it's the starting spot for the League. There are some interesting sections, though. A wide S turn in the business district, where keeping a correct line is important. A section in the open desert trought ruined columns, followed by a bump and a quick right-left chicane. A loop-the-loop, where it's important to pitch your ship up. And finally, a twisting, very wide left turn with a track Turbo you can't afford to miss. This track is where each and every young SRRL pilot completes his first laps."
global.trackDescription[1] = "Khamsim is not particularly demanding, but some sharp turns make it a more technical track than Calima. Fun fact: all right turns are pretty wide, while there's just three left turns: one is but a slight bent in the track, the other two are tough hairpins. There's an S turn right after the start that can be faced full-throttle by making good use of the right-stick strafe. There's also a short jump, tricky enough to be challenging for greenhorns as it lands between the half-destroyed buildings of the Medina. "
global.trackDescription[2] = "A beautiful, spectacular circuit, Simoom winds down through the slums, grazes the surface of the river, whirls up above the rocks and down into a rocky canyon, before a final big air jump above the pyramids and lunging towards the end. It's easy to grind the barriers in the slow initial section: after that, the left turn that leads over the river is more tricky than it looks. Look at he turn signals, as there's also a blind right turn where the track dives down inside the canyon."
global.trackDescription[3] = "The highlights of Sirocco, no doubt, are the open desert and the wide left-turning section revolving around a huge oasis. Besides these two points, it doesn't present major landmarks, but from the technical perspective it shows an interesting S that can be faced flat-out if taken correctly, and a huge wide banked left turn after that. Visibility, is often limited due to the sand and the strong wind, which makes this track particulary tricky at times."
global.trackDescription[4] = "Ghibli was built almost as a PR stunt, a show off to demonstrate what anti-gravity magnets could do back in the early days of AG racing. The outrageous loop-and-twist that comes shortly after the starting line is 40 meters tall (130ft) and presents a right-left-right bend while descending and returning towards zero inclination. It's called the Ghibli Knot and, despite its age, it still remains one of the most fascinating sections of the Redout league. The second landmark is a huge straight section towards the end that was used to test engine speed limits: the following jump is very tricky, as it's easy to overshoot and land right in the middle of the following left turn, or worse, crash in the sand. "
global.trackDescription[5] = "Speedway is a fast circuit, but not as fast as the name would suggest. Right after the start there's a super slow and technical section with a tight left, a hairpin right, a blind left curve right after a bump, followed by another tight right. A teleporter marks the beginning of a fast straight section with an almost harmless S, two half loops, then a wide left turn, after which another fast section starts. It's paramount to control the pitch on those slopes. The last turn is a heavily banked right that can be faced flat-out, before teleporting back to the starting line. "
global.trackDescription[6] = "Explorer is quite technical, much slower than the Speedway and much, much trickier. The initial section is a right-banked dive inside a massive ice cave, a long tricky left turn that leads to a teleporter, and another section inside the very same cave that presents two interesting left turns, one of which is a banked hairpin. The track then moves outside, climbs above a gigant iceberg, then lunges twards the finish line. The final jump is ridiculously tricky as the landing is not aligned with the takeoff, but slightly on the left."
global.trackDescription[7] = "This track is built around the thrill of jumping, specifically to make Redout races more spectacular for the public. The opening is a wide left turn that leads in a ship graveyard. Turns are wide, but the track gets quite narrow. The following two big-air jumps are increasingly difficult: the first one is free from obstacles, while the second crosses two track sections, presenting a high risk of collision. The last jump right before the finish line is short, but tricky because of the low takeoff speed and the frozen fog that sometimes rises in this part of the track."
global.trackDescription[8] = "One of the most technical circuits of the whole league, Vertigo presents loads of narrow corners. Drivers are welcomed by a tight banked hairpin left turn, leading uphill towards another left turn. A quick descending left-right leads to another wide left turn, but the right turn that follows is the most tight and difficult of the entire race. The left barrier in this point has been replaced countless times due to drivers constantly slamming into it. Then the track starts spinning, up to the outrageous left-handed corkscrew: an epic section that leads to the final teleporter, who is often missed by drivers who feel sick or pass out due to the extreme G forces of the last section. "
global.trackDescription[9] = "Revolving, informally called the pass out amongst pilots, is one of the most demanding Redout tracks in terms of G forces. The first spinning section, going in and out a frozen cave, leads to a central section of wide open turns, before a dangerous jump landing between gigantic ice blocks. But it's after the teleporter that things get messy: the negative G forces of the final track section have already proven fatal for a number of drivers, who either sustained permanent physical damage due to the red-out effect, or passed out and crashed badly in the following turn. "
global.trackDescription[10] = "Bridges is a very long, fast racetrack featuring mostly wide turns, S turns and some spinning. It's also the first racetrack in the League to present sections without protections, which may create problems in the first right turn. What follows is two wide turns, one right after a half-loop, the other completely vertical, right under the roots of the gigantic tree. Originally, this part of the track ran in a tunnel excavated in the mountain, but the enormous roots of the tree crushed the rock until portion of the mountain completely collapsed. The loop-and-twist in the central section is very similar to the one installed in Cairo Chibli, but mirrored (it bens right instead of left) and a little more curved inwards. The final jump lands on the water surface, before teleporting the ship back onto the bridges. "
global.trackDescription[11] = "Seaside Hills starts along the coastline, hanging from a cliff above the sea. A wide left turn leads to a pipe section, the first one ever built and the first one Redout drivers usually face in their racing career. The following section goes deep inside the forest, becoming gradually more and more technical as the track goes around roots and branches. The vegetation here is so aggressive that entire track sections had to be replaced in multiple occasions, because roots and branches would bend and crush the lateral protections. The SRRL thought about redesigning this section completely, to avoid the high maintenance fees, but this classic race is so fascinating that fans protested. In the end, the original design was not altered. "
global.trackDescription[12] = "Mountain road is a surprising circuit that has gone through numerous modifications, as the mountain it was originally laid upon got almost entirely crushed by the gigantic tree towers above the racing complex. As a result, the first halt of the track looks entirely different from the original track design. The first section is a challenging series of thigh bends, followed by a gallery and a wide, fast spinning section bravely build beneath the tree. After straightforward section on the beach, the track climbs steadily with a very long left turn, before jumping into the sea. The underwater section is also new: at the time this track was originally built, running underwater was impossible. "
global.trackDescription[13] = "Swift Passage is a rather confusing track. Its initial section is hard to remember because it doesn't show any landmarks: it's only after the banked left turn onto a bridge with no barriers, that the track starts becoming memorable. A spinning section between the branches of a huge tree leads to a very long jump. The track then bends right (a tight and dangerous corner) and goes around the swamp. To more big air jumps then await: the second one is especially tricky as it requires drivers to jump through a circular teleporter gate. "
global.trackDescription[14] = "Unmanned is a puzzling racetrack that almost looks like it was designed in jest. The first section is quite canonical: a big jump, a wide right turn, and a brief trio of left-right-left bends, after which the track goes bonkers and it becomes almost impossible to describe what happens. Pilots usually say that it's no use trying to memorize the Unmanned: you just go with the flow and try not to smash against the barriers. What pilots remember all too well is the last jump, between the giant tree roots. This jump is extremely dangerous, not only for the obstacles in the path, but also because landing on the track is far from trivial, especially at high speeds. This jump used to be even more dangerous and was called the Death Leap. Pilots refused to run in many occasions, protesting against the poor safely of this track: as a result, the landing section was straightened and the jump made more straightforward, but it remains one of the most dangerous sections of the entire SRRL. "
global.trackDescription[15] = "Jumping, flying, wide turns, tight turns, blind cornering, strong G forces: Fingertips is an all-round test for Redout pilots and an excellent introductory circuit for the very hard SRRL Volcano Racing Complex. Amongst drivers it's common to say if you can complete on Fingertips, you can complete anywhere: that's only partially true, as there are other Volcano tracks that are much more demanding. The first jump is already tricky, as the landing spot is elevated and it's easy to overshoot. Other relevant spots are the wide banked left turn after the barrierless bridge, the S turn above the lava, and the lopp-the-loop where two jumps intersect."
global.trackDescription[16] = "The SRRL built Volcano Racing Complex in order to attract more public. Their priority was creating exciting tracks for exciting races. Deep Dive reflects this philosophy quite well: not many racing tracks dive straight into the mouth of a volcano. The lava and the extreme temperatures are kept at bay using the same principle behind the EPSS powerup. If cutting through a sea of magma was not spectacular enough, what follows is a huge vertical jump heading straight down. Drivers fall through a circular teleporting gate and are catapulted horizontally onto the track. Deep Dive is quite technical, alternating between wide and tight turns, and barriers are missing in different sections. "
global.trackDescription[17] = "Underground Tour is a very interesting, spectacular and technical circuit, that explores the abandoned mining complex hidden beneath the mountain. The first section is a mix of flat, fast S turn before a blind hairpin left corner, a real trap. Another landmark is the 3/4 loop-the-loop that leads down towards the fossilized remains of some ancient animals: a few are authentic, but the majority are replicas. The following pipe section is also very interesting: confused pilots often can't identify where bottom is, and will get crushed in the jump that follows. A negative G section and another risky jump complete this marvelous course. "
global.trackDescription[18] = "As the name suggest, this track unfolds entirely in the volcano magmatic chamber. It begins with a simple left turn, leading into a ridiculous screwdriver spin that ends in an abrupt, tight and difficult right turn. What follows is a crooked and convoluted section, a nightmare to race in high classes, but quickly the track becomes more straight and increasingly faster, up to a dangerous big air jump amongst lava columns, with a non-trivial landing. Many mining structures, gigantic excavators and mechanical drills from the old mining complex can still be seen laying around the track. Those are all originals and were never moved since the SRRL bought the mine and everything inside, believing that altering anything would detract from the spirit of the location. "
global.trackDescription[19] = "Hell is not a nickname given by pilots, but the original track name given by its designers. They believed no racers would actually compete here, and that the SRRL was just showing off. They were completely wrong: the track was built and immediately inaugurated in season 2532-33. Hell is by far the longest track in the SRRL and it goes from the very bottom of the Volcano Complex. A technical, narrow initial section leads pilots through the southern coastline, teleporting them back into the bay, then straight down into the magmatic chamber. Here, a difficult big air jump awaits: drivers need to hit a short straight landing after an upward jump of 300 meters (920 ft). A quick section packed with swift turns follows, before teleporting pilots back outside, ready for the main course of this track: the longest, biggest, most exaggerated jump of the entire league. The first six races held on Hell saw no pilots crossing the finish line. Only in the seventh edition, a pilot driving ESA-AGR would manage to survive the jump four times and complete the race: that was Thomas HK Mermand Senior, who would later become SRRL Chief Operating Officer."
global.trackDescription[20] = "The initial part of this track is an underwater pipe, shaped like one of the original coils that were dug and activated into the Europa permafrost in order to melt it. Most of this racetrack is actually a pipe, which makes it uniquely difficult as it's not easy to determine the best trajectory. In the central section of the track, one piece of the pipe is missing. It was originally removed for maintenance, although the resulting pipe-to-pipe jump proven to be so unique and challenging that the SRRL designers didn't replace the missing piece. Where the pipe opens, the track presents a challenging lack of barriers which makes cutting some corners possible, although risky."
global.trackDescription[21] = "This track runs on the shallow bottom of the sea, amongst glowing rocks and crystals. It presents some slow sections, but there's an overall quick rhythm and flow to it. Pick a ship with good handling. The initial part is a series of progressively narrow corners up to the first air jump. The central section shows some long straights, a hairpin left turn suspended over the depths of the Europa Trench, and another big air jump. The final section runs on the sea bed, twisting beneath and around the abandoned terraforming facilities before teleporting back to the start. "
global.trackDescription[22] = "The starting grid of Trench is placed on a straight that immediately dives down in deep waters. In fact, this track is the deepest and newest of the complex, spanning the entire length of the Europa Trench. After the initial dive, the track further sinks down with a series of twisting corners. Visibility on the next turn is pretty good as the track goes down, although there's little light coming from the surface. The central section is the highlight of the track: a long jump that goes into a double loop-the-loop. Drivers need to turn right while in the middle of the loop, so they are able to floow the track into the final section, a pipe and a series of slower turns. "
global.trackDescription[23] = "Like first jump is underwater, although it almost goes up to the surface presenting a jump out of the water. It's the fastest Europa track, with a very long straight initial packed with turbos. The first jump is underwater, although it almost goes up to the surface. The second jump sends pilots flying over a strip of land, above a radio facility, landing back into the sea. The final and most remarkable jump is underwater, leading pilots to sink all the way down from shallow waters to the deep. "
global.trackDescription[24] = "Surface Sprint is the only Europa racetrack where pilots spend the majority of their time out of the water. It's so tricky that pilots often call it The Trap. The first challenge is a double off-axis jump right after the start. The landing of the first jump is a strip on the right, which leads to another jump that lands on a straight section on the left. The challenge continues with an upside-down jump and an elevated, fast S turn that descents back down, with a few missing barrier. The underwater section of the track shows nothing remarkable, while the last jump can be very tricky if faced at top speed. "
global.trackDescription[25] = "The Mobius Speedway was the first ever AG test track build outside any kind of atmosphere. Heavily relying on the Neptune Space Station structures, it was named after the famous Mobius Strip. That’s because part of the racetrack is ‘folded’ upon itself, in order to keep it compact and optimize the construction effort. There is one very short jump, build to test AG vehicles behavior while flying in space. The SRRL decided not to dismantle the track after testing, but rather host official races on it"
global.trackDescription[26] = "Escape Velocity was built specifically to test longer flying sections in open space, although these jumps almost always head towards the center of the track for safety reason: during tests, this made it much easier to recover stray ships in case of failed landings. As a result, almost all jumps cross trajectories, which make long races extremely exciting for the public. Pilots have initially expressed concerns for the risk of collisions, although constant evolution of respawn devices and life-saving emergency capsules has greatly reduced safety concerns in recent years. The last jump presents a unique trait: it’s the only branching jump in the SRRL. Pilots need to choose their trajectory to navigate around the central obstacle."
global.trackDescription[27] = "The Red Giant is broadly split in two sections. The initial part presents a series of regular up-and-downs, which causes heavy positive and negative G stresses. The negative G effect is especially amplified due to the lack of gravity, which gives this track the name. Right after that comes a series of turns, two 90 degree and two hairpins, rather compact and slow. The second part is a series of three dangerous jumps: the landing is not visible on the second one, while the third jump trajectory crosses some gigantic moving space radars. Pilots need to avoid the obstacles and hit the teleporting gate: a true test of skill."
global.trackDescription[28] = "Heavily relying on jumps, this is the track that moves further away from the space station into deep space – hence the name. Although strictly speaking, the ‘jump’ sections should be called ‘flying’ sections. The key challenge is, in fact, to maneuver your vehicle well enough to land on the next strip of track, rather than pursuing trajectories on a plain surface."
global.trackDescription[29] = "Asteroids takes the Drifting concept to the extreme: almost 50% of racing time is spent flying in open space, navigating around asteroids and flying towards the next surface. It’s not a long track, but it allows for some faring maneuvers and trajectories. Half of the public – the racing purists – hate this track, as its really far from a traditional AG race. The other half loves it for the same reason. Meanwhile, pilots bravely continue to accept the same old challenge, that is ‘run this track in the least possible time’ even when an extra dimension is added."
global.trackDescription[30] = "Voxel is a high-speed circuit that really benefits from track memorization. Pilots are presented with a variety of turns: high visibility, low visibility, S turns, and a jump. There’s no hairpins, racing lines are clean and interesting."
global.trackDescription[31] = "Stack is a rather twisting track, with two 270 degree and many S turns. The highlight is probably the long central jump, in which pilots are kept from falling by three transparent landing strips suspended in the middle of it."
global.trackDescription[32] = "Loop is one of the few VERTEX tracks that includes heavy G forces: those were intentionally limited in the track design, because they would strain the simulator hydraulics and because there were much better suited machines for training pilots in this aspect, such as G centrifuges."
global.trackDescription[33] = "Verticality, two hairpins and a 270 degree turn, this track is definitely the most challenging of the VERTEX, although the risk of falling off the track is limited compared to other circuits. This is the oldest track to have been implemented in the VERTEX."
global.trackDescription[34] = "Breakpoint is the newest VERTEX track, designed by the SRRL with a focus on visual impact. For this reason, is the track with the most interesting and varied architecture, and with the most whacky design. It shows a segmented loop-the-loop, windy sections, a good verticality, missing barriers and many variations in the track banking."
global.trackDescription[35] = "One of the Martians tracks with the most verticality, Mariner features long, wide stretches in the Marian sand, alternate with slow hairpin and S turns, and some acrobatic elements: one loop, an elevated turn, a very tall inverse loop and a final corkscrew loop – similar to Alaska Vertigo, but much wider. Mariner takes its name from the 1964 spacecraft send to Mars by NASA and JPL, the first satellite to successfully complete a flyby of the Red Planet, sending the first pictures of its surface back to Earth."
global.trackDescription[36] = "Spirit, as every race track in the Mars Racing Complex, is named after a Martian rover, in this case the one that operated between 2004 and 2009. This track really incarnates the pioneering spirit of AG racing: floaty, bendy, fast, and extremely dangerous. The lateral barriers are missing in many portions of the track, allowing for daring trajectories. The huge big air jump over the terraforming greenhouses and the technical last section on the ground are still unchanged from the original design. The element of surprise In this case is the external half-pipe straight section in the second half of the track."
global.trackDescription[37] = "Opportunity is a remarkable track for many reasons. First, the impossibly large pip in which pilots dive in straight form the first bug air jump. Second, the fast sequence of turbo boosts between the first and second underground section, which are especially challenging to hit in the wide right turn. Third, the ‘Martian Knot’, alias for the final twisting section before the jump. Last but not least, the final teleporter, as this was the very first teleporter ever placed on a Redout circuit."
global.trackDescription[38] = "Curiosity is a very peculiar track, given that almost half of it takes part on the external section of a tubular track. This poses a unique set of challenges for the pilots: how to keep the ideal line, how to maximize the centrifugal effect, and especially how not to miss takeoffs and landings when transitioning between pipe and flat track sections. Curiosity rewards speed well over handling, given that the pilots are capable of staying on course."
global.trackDescription[39] = "If Curiosity is peculiar, Schiapparelli is a full out weird track. Its central section is the most remarkable: a long blind landing on a pipe section, which becomes rather convoluted, leading to a unique pipe section that is ran both on the outside and the inside. Greenhorns are usually very confused when facing this track for the first time, even after seeing other pilots compete on it."
global.trackDescription[40] = "This relatively fast and short track runs above and through the middle of a residential complex, still inhabited by about 4000 colonists. Two portions of the track, in the central section and towards the end, run directly on the lunar soil. The starting grid is positioned inside one of the major lunar comm relays: the magnetic interference is so strong that the entire relay needs to be shut down during races, and the SRRL provides alternative connections through a network of satellites"
global.trackDescription[41] = "Dangerous does not cut it. Space Park, much like s’skatepark and snowpark, is a playground for experienced AG pilots to showboat. Desperate terraforming attempts have forever changed the face and shape of the Moon: huge cracks in its surface were a consequence of these operations. SpacePark is built inside one of these cracks, running for several hundreds miles. The canyon is riddled with floating debris and structural supports, making every jump extremely dangerous. Coupled with the very low gravity, this is a recipe for thrilling, if not deadly, races."
global.trackDescription[42] = "Despite terraforming on the Moon did not work, important technological advancements were made in the attempt. An extraordinary breakthrough was the creation of an artificial, thin layer of atmosphere. Enormous reactor synthesize and pump chemicals such as oxygen, and create an artificial magnetic field: humans can walk freely on the surface of the Moon for up to 20 minutes. The Reactor track revolves around one of these extraordinary structures, going deep down  to its core and presenting some massive jumps"
global.trackDescription[43] = "The vast majority of the energy used on the Moon comes from solar farms. This track is built just next to a huge canyon, inside one of the Moon smallest solar farms. Its peculiarity is that, for a very short section, it literally runs on the surface of the solar panels."
global.trackDescription[44] = "Trailblazer consists of two rather different sections. The first one runs above the canyon and goes down to the reactor core. A teleporter brings pilot to the second section, a streak of lunar desert out in the open, rather far from the rest of the racing complex. The final section teleports pilots back to the canyon, with a spectacular downward jump above its supporting structures."
global.trackDescription[45] = "The original design of this track facilitated the use of offensive weapons. Straight and narrow sections didn’t grant much space for evasive maneuver, and contestants would be more easily able to shoot each other down. Turns in the first section are very wide and fast, while the central section presents more technical challenges, including a very narrow blind hairpin left."
global.trackDescription[46] = "The initial and final section of Annapurna follow the old track design, running low on the ground and following natural irregularities of the terrain, creating some extremely tight corners. The central section was ideated by the SRRL to be more in line with modern racing standard: quite elevated, including two loops and a pipe section."
global.trackDescription[47] = "It its design philosophy, Durga is very similar to Kali, but it goes much higher above the ground, presents more inclination, and is even faster. Its highlights are without doubt the double passage grazing the planet’s highly toxic ammonia and copper waterfalls, and a spectacular view of AR219 cracked satellite."
global.trackDescription[48] = "With its large and fast turns, Shiva was designed for Speed events. It’s still very faithful to its original design, exception made for a couple of elevated passages. Shiva was the only track where miners would run time trials, and a preferred location for training."
global.trackDescription[49] = "Vishnu is the only interplanetary Redout active racetrack, taking place on two distinct celestial bodies: AR219, and its moon. The track leads pilots up in the high atmosphere. Then a section called “the interplanetary cannon” shoots them out in space, to land on the cracked satellite. It’s the longest, fastest, craziest jump of the entire League, made even more difficult by the presence of space debris and asteroids. Not many pilots have the guts to face it."
global.trackDescription[50] = "As giant trees were growing uncontrollably outside, other forms of vegetation developed inside these caves. Gigantic glowing mushrooms, to be exact. As a result, the Glowing Cave is anything but dark. The wreckage of a high-orbital, single-seat recon ship can be seen at the entrance of the cave: the ship is about 150 years old. Next, the track goes in another cave, then jumps outside through an opening behind a waterfall. The final section takes pilots to ground level, running through some standard-size pine trees who pale if compared to the nearby sequoias."
global.trackDescription[51] = "The SRRL was convinced that a racetrack inside the gigantic sequoia forest would be the highlight of this entire complex. To an extent, they were right, although locals revered the forest as sacred, and therefore not a single tree could be taken down. Designers had to scratch their heads a lot in order to find enough space to develop a racetrack inside the compact, almost oppressive atmosphere of the forest, without touching trees to open up the space. The track is therefore extremely windy, crawling in and around trees: hence the name."
global.trackDescription[52] = "Kin Shijaa is the Navajo name of this settlement, built out of rock and wood in the side of the mountain. The track begins above the river, drives up above and then down in to the city, goes around with a right hairpin, and then down towards the water. After a very technical central part, the track goes down on the ground level and pilots run on the grass, between rocks and stumps. A final elevated, wide right turn was segmented into 3 sections by the designers for a much harder challenge."
global.trackDescription[53] = "This racetrack is named after the stunning waterfall dominating the valley. The starting grid is placed strategically to show the landmark through an enormous sequoia stump, a joy for photographers. The track then revolves around a sacred totem, which is believed to be protecting Kin Shijaa inhabitants since it was erected, 300 years ago. After a rather technical central section, the racetrack goes back to the waterfall for a spectacular, fast passage behind it."
global.trackDescription[54] = "Tsintah can be translated as ‘Forest’ and, unsurprisingly, is the forest’s name. This track goes up above the sequoias, then down through the dead trunk of one of these gigantic trees. The central section is close to the ground, not tremendously fast but far from the technicality of Serpent. The track grazes the river’s waters before going back to the start."
global.trackDescription[55] = "The flying rocks and the low gravity of his region still puzzle the scientists, but the SRRL didn’t need an explanation to harness the charm of the location. The circuit of Floating Falls is built around these rocks. It goes down grazing the surface of a water pong, partially navigates around the wreckage of Titan III, then goes back up towards the elevated finish line."
global.trackDescription[56] = "A vast system of underground caves filled with water was discovered after the crashing of Titan III. This track revolves around some of the flying rocks, then dives down beneath the surface in a dangerous jump. The cave is overflowing with life: vegetation who learned to survive in a scarce light. Sapphire Grotto also offers a glimpse of what happens beneath the surface of the pools. After a series of tight turns on the liquid surface, a teleporter takes pilots back to the start."
global.trackDescription[57] = "Being on Earth, these pools are obviously not filled with liquid methane, but carry a certain resemblance with the methane pools that can be found on Titan, original destination of the Titan III ship which crashed here. Plus, abundant reserves of methane were found deep below these caves, although fossil fuel has been largely replaced, and therefore it was not extracted."
global.trackDescription[58] = "Neon Crystals runs in the second major chamber of the Rotorua underground cave complex. It’s a racetrack with strong verticality and a couple of fast and dangerous passages. The highlight of the track is undoubtedly the external tube section, the following segmented loop-the-loop, and the straight section inside the pipe."
global.trackDescription[59] = "This was originally known as the Rotorua Pools. Nowadays, the location is called the Rotorua Crater, because of the massive depression created after the impact of the colonizing ship. This track starts in the Neon Cave before jumping inside the ship through a breach in the hill and exploring its left wing. A good portion of the internal structure was removed, anything the contained useful or rare materials, leaving even more open space for the racetrack, especially the central fuselage. After a twisting section, the track squeezes through a narrow passage and goes out in the open, for an almost complete tour of the Titan II."
global.trackDescription[60] = "Desert, pyramids, rocks, a river, an oasis, a once grand business district alongside slums and crumbling ruins: the Cairo racetrack is this and much more. Built in 2486, is the most ancient racing complex still active to date and it’s uniquely fascinating. It was built in parallel with another racing complex at the North Pole, later abandoned. The five tracks went through radical modifications during the years, but many sections still retain their original design, and maybe that's why fans and drivers alike are always fascinated by this location."
global.trackDescription[61] = "The Alaskan SRRL Racing Complex was built in 2554, so it's been active for 6 years only. Although global warming has melted the ice caps, the microclimate of this region shows an average temperature of -12°F (-24°C), despite the presence of the sea. After the North Pole Racing Complex was abandoned in 2512 due to inadequate security standards and heavy maintenance costs, the SRRL decided to build another complex altogether in a region even more extreme, to offer more exciting races and to test a new form of magnetic suspension tech."
global.trackDescription[62] = "The remainings of the Italian coastline: here lies the second oldest racing complex of the league, built in 2492. The early days of AG racing unfolded on Mars, in Cairo, and here. For some mysterious anomaly, vegetation has started growing uncontrollably since 2499. Some say it's a side effect of chemicals used to cool down the first models of magnetic stabilizers, but the SRRL always refused to comment on the matter. Trees and branches started to grow at such a frantic pace they would completely obstruct entire portions of the tracks overnight. The location was abandoned in 2501 due to unsustainable maintenance costs. In 2512, the SRRL returned to Abruzzo with the intention of restoring the racing complex to its former glory. An entire section of the mountain had collapsed under the pressure of gigantic tree and the entire track sections had disappeared completely, but the vegetation has stopped growing so aggressively. The area was cleaned up, some tracks were redesigned, and the glorious Abruzzo SRRL Racing Complex reopened in 2514. "
global.trackDescription[63] = "The Volcano Racing Complex is located on an the Moutohora island. In year 2512, the SRRL insisted on building a racing complex in this volcanic island, spending an outrageous amount of money to purchase it, including the mining complex hidden beneath, and acquiring the mining company who initially refused to sell. The result is a stunning, highly spectacular racing complex that goes arround the island, dips underwater, dives into the crater, and explores all the chambers that have been dug and expanded underneath. Pilots dart and jump around huge mining structures, gigantic crystals, lava falls and pools, performing the most spectacular and risky jumps of the League. "
global.trackDescription[64] = "In their quest for more inhabitable space, humanity was able to partially dissolve the thick icy crust that used to wrap Europa, one of the Jupiter's largest moons. The satellite was never colonised because of the rigid temperatures, thought. All that remains is the terraforming equipment and facilities, abandoned on its surface. The SRRL decided to design and build a racing complex here due to the incredible charm of the location. Works were completed in 2544 and races have been held here for 12 years. Then, the complex was temporarily coled due to track maintenance and redesign, as the SRRL wanted to delve deeper down in the Europa sea. The SRRL Europa Racing Complex has just reopened: it's 2560, and pilots can finally race again with Jupiter in the background."
global.trackDescription[65] = "After the construction of the Europa racing complex, the SRRL joined forces with NASA to pursue a seemingly impossible project. The Neptune Space Station, primarily built by NASA, was scheduled to end its mission after 30 years from construction: however, Neptune was officially declared unfit for terraforming after only 9 years, and very little relevant data had been collected after that announcement. The SRRL asked permission to build a racetrack on the Neptune Space Station, harnessing its power and construction machinery, to test a groundbreaking concept: AG racing at zero gravity. Works were completed within 8 years, and in 2552 the first ESA ship completed a lap on the test circuit of Mobius Speedway. The remaining circuits were built within 6 years: the Neptune Racing Complex was born. Its stunning zero-G jumps pushed the boundaries of AG racing into the field of space racing."
global.trackDescription[66] = "Acronym for Virtual Environment for Redout Training EXperiance, this is not a real racing location, but a simulation. The VERTEX software, originally called VOID, was built upon the first simulations programs written by the Oikos-Sea team. Their goal was to test different vehicle assets, but the software became especially useful for training greenhorns. The simulation became so pivotal in the development of Redout Pilots that trainees from different teams started challenging each other on it. Sveta Savitskaya wrote a network layer in her spare time, for the fun of watching real-time races on the system. The Federation soon decided to stream these unofficial competitions, then added minor VERTEX events in the junior league. In just a few years, VERTEX races made their way into the official season."
global.trackDescription[67] = "There are 3 locations that marked the early history of AG Racing: Cairo, Abruzzo, and Mars. The Mars Racing Complex was built in the Xanthe Terra region, the least successful in terms fo terraforming due to an unfavorable composition of soil. This racing complex, especially the wide flat tracks running in and around the craters, have seen countless battles and races, featuring early days racing teams that have ceased o exist. It was built in 2488, Just two years later than Cairo, but for over 10 years it was the testing ground for the legendary Oikos-Sea engineering team of ESA-AGR. Over time, the Mars Racing Complex endured a countless series of redesigns and updates, especially to keep up with the initially soft safety regulations, but also to experiment with low-gravity races that would alter lead to the construction of the Moon and Neptune racetracks. The spirit of the Martian tracks tells a tale of bravery, an insatiable search for speed and the will to break new grounds."
global.trackDescription[68] = "Wheeled racing on the Moon have provided an enjoyable pastime for humanity since 2400. The desperate terraforming attempts had forever changed the face of the planet: its surface was cracked with multiple canyons, some hundreds of miles deep, and an artificial atmosphere, albeit very thin, was created. Thanks to the low gravity and wide-open space available, pilots could produce in spectacular jumps, dangerous turns and infinite drifts. The Lunar Rally Championship is the competition that saw Conqueror’s early days. The technology for Redout racetracks was tested outside the Moon’s atmosphere around 2420, but the construction of a proper Lunar Redout Racing Complex down on the surface began only around 2500."
global.trackDescription[69] = "One might think that, given the costs involved, AG racing would never happen outside the official circuits. But that would be underestimating the recklessness proper of human nature. Planetoid AR219, on the outskirts of the solar system, was a far-out yet profitable mining location. In 2468, a group of miners and engineers organized a series of clandestine AG races, constructing rough ships and tracks using mining vehicles and equipment. The company decided not to intervene against this obvious violation, which provided a good distraction for the hundreds of worn-out, spacesick and bored workers. Soon enough, the races became frequent and violent, including sabotages and the use of offensive weapons. The company had to put a halt to the races after dozens of pilots were killed or severely injured. The SRRL purchased the location and built a racing complex in 2499, following some of the original racetrack design."
global.trackDescription[70] = "The Sequoia Valley is home to the oldest trees that survived on Earth. It's located where the state of Alberta, Canada used to be. Trees had been growing at this latitude since approximately 2100 and haven’t stopped since. It only took about a hundred years for sequoias to reach 50m (160ft). A large colony of humans escaping from the dramatic consequences of global warming established here, and remarkably remained almost completely isolated for almost 400 years. Curious fact, the majority of these survivors were of Navajo heritage, and the second largest group was an entire brigade of Scottish soldiers operating in North America. When the SRRL officials landed for an inspection in 2551 they found homes carved in the stone, skilled woodworkers, and majestic scenery for the next Redout acing complex. Negotiations with the locals have been swift, and after only 8 years, the Sequoia SRRL racing Complex opened to the public."
global.trackDescription[71] = "The Rotorua is a deserted region of New Zealand, Earth. It’s sadly famous for the wreckage of the Expedition Titan III, a colossal shipwreck that saw a Class IV Colonizer ship crashing on the planet surface after failing a gravitational kick. The region shows an abundance of geothermal activity, plus a very curious group of floating rocks, and a remarkably lower gravity fore than the rest of Earth. Scientists are still unable to explain the causes behind this phenomenon, although aerostatic lift and magnetic repulsion are believed to play a role. The decision to build a racing complex on the burial grounds of thousands of colonists caused a fit of public uproar. But the location is too fascinating and the influence of the SRRL on the masses is simply too strong. It’s year 2560 and pilots are now ready to explore the low-gravity anomaly of the Rotorua region."

//ESA-AGR
global.team_lore[0,0] = "ESA-AGR was born as a branch of the European Space Agency when prototyping high-atmosphere patrol aircrafts during the Mars colonisation. The advancements in aerodynamics, efficient propulsion and electromagnetic fields were crucial in the effort of terraforming the Red Planet. They also happened to be very useful when it came to build crazy fast racing hoverships. Its founders helped build the very first AG racing competition, encouraged and financially supported the development of the SRRL Solar Redout Racing League from its inception. As a result, the ESA-AGR is the team with the longest and most honoured history in AG Racing. The ESA-AGR is an all-rounder. Acceleration and magnetic grip are amongst the best in the league, and the ship is average in everything else. The power-up and turbo energy pool is slightly below par: battery capacity and generators are kept to a minimum to avoid encumbrance and reduce weight. It’s a very good team for drivers who don’t rely too much on power-ups and prefer a canonical race approach."
global.team_lore[0,1] = "The Vanguard is the oldest Redout hovership design still competing in the league. It's a straight adaption of the high-atmosphere patrolling vehicle Venture III, as evident from the lateral fans. It's history is basically the history of how AG racing was born. ESA allowed its employees to spend limited amounts of working time on extra projects. A team of engineers got their hands on a retired Venture III and experimented with a new system of magnetic suspension on it, wondering how it would be like to place one of these blazing-fast vehicles on a racetrack. Their names were Kapoor, Capelli, Anderson, and Balewa. ESA found out only when one of its sheds on Mars burst into flames, after an incident with magnetic superconductors. Instead of disciplining the four engineers, the company decided to grant them a limited amount of funds to complete their work, while releasing the specs for the magnetic suspenders to the public hoping that others would develop their own vehicles. The first Vanguard was effectively built and presented in 2472. The Mars AG Racing event was created, the first AG competition ever, taking place on a single track 12km (7,5 miles) long. The Vanguard was driven by Lucious Kapoor, son of Herman Kapoor, one of the four engineers who basically invented AG racing, and won it by storm"
global.team_lore[0,2] = "While the Vanguard was an haphazard experiment by the Martian ESA engineers, the initial victory and enormous attention that AG racing generated in the public ringed as a resonating wake up call for the entire company. The result of huge investments and a super scale approach to development, the Hussar is a super-competitive piece of aerodynamics engineering and power. The chassis is slender, and the single-engine architecture was ditched by placing two smaller, but more power engines on the external wings. With the Hussar, ESA-AGR started investing heavily on the entire soon-to-be SRRL and contributed to development of this sport."
global.team_lore[0,3] = "The Lancer came as an incremental upgrade to the Hussar in a time were ESA-AGR was starting to perform poorly in all event types: competition caught up, Koeniggswerth Engineering and ASERA appeared on the scene and soon overtook Hussars with ease. ESA-AGR had been investing the entire economic reserve of the company into the SRRL, but results were lacking and investors were getting angry. Management abandonded the sinking ship, but luckily the core engineering team called the Oikos-Sea kept crunching until the last day, including Kapoor and Anderson who served the company for their entire lives. More of a prototype than any other ESA ship, the Lancer has been put together without enough time to polish the design properly. The result is a beast in terms of acceleration and magnetic grip, but lacks a lot in battery capacity and turbo."
global.team_lore[0,4] = "The Dragoon is the latest masterpiece of the Oikos-Sea engineering team. Despite ESA being the oldest team in activity, they never bothered competing in Class IV until this model was built relatively recently, in 2540. The SRRL was getting lots of negative attention after the completion of the Hell track in Volcano: their quest for highly risky but spectacular races backfired when, for six times in a row, nobody was able to complete the race and pilots began refusing to race, concerned for their safety. Thomas HK Mermand Senior, pilot and engineer, came to the rescue. He took responsibility of leading the design team in enhancing the Lancer, to create the first Class IV ESA-AGR hovership. The result was the Dragoon, the most powerful hovership of its time, which completed the Hell track on its first try and won the 2540-41, 41-42, 42-43 and 43-44 championships by storm."
//Koeniggswerth Engineering
global.team_lore[1,0] = "The name Koeniggswerth Engineering is ancient. It originally belonged to a german team, which regularly ran in various touring car competitions on Earth long before the colonisation. It was one of the last teams to disband before the Exodus, when humanity had to flee the Earth. Re-established in year 2450 on terraformed mars by the great-grandson of the last owner, the team competed without interruption in canonical fourwheeled racing leagues for 22 years before the SRRL was created. Initially reluctant to join anti-gravity racing because of the massive costs involved, the team was able to step up a few years later thanks to substantial investments from a group of former north european and and US energy companies. Koeniggswerth ships are heavy and sturdy, with great magnetic grip and the toughest structure amongst all racing teams. The energy accumulators alsohave good capacity and regeneration rate, which grants a good turbo boost but also creates further weight. This comes at the cost of acceleration and maximum speed, which are slightly below standard, but the durability of these ships is unmatched. Drivers who prefer endurance over performances canconfidently remain in the middle of the pack and outlast their opponents, or skip ahead at the right moment with a well-timed turbo"
global.team_lore[1,1] = "The Centaur was built with one and only one goal in mind: rack up as many points from Survival and Arena Race events. Koeniggswerth joined the SRRL with a very limited capital pool: investors had agreed to spend enough money to establish the team and create its first ship, but a clause would allow them to bail out and resell everything in case they didn't score a certain number points in the season. Therefore, their effort was very focused on two event types, in order to maximize their chances. Koeniggswerth Engineering and their founder Karl Gottlyeb-Daimar decided to go all-in in what they knew how to do best: durability and materials. The Centaur, with its lateral force-grid shields, is the reflection of this philosophy. Equipped with a heavy engine, a simple but effective energy battery and turbines, but especially tons of thick armor, the ship was able to compete effectively and to collect twice as many points as needed to keep Koeniggswerth in the game."
global.team_lore[1,2] = "Koeniggswerth managed to create a competitive Class I racecraft with the Centaur. The encouraging results allowed them to pursue the creation of a Class II racecraft, following the same base philosophy. The chassis is the same is the of the Centaur, but the engines have been expanded and the energy generators made more efficient. Keeping a low weight was never a top priority for Koeniggswerth. The strong point of this ship remains its durability but the Jormungandr Turbo Boost had been researched more thoroughly, partially compensating for the slow acceleration. The Jormungandr consistently scored good results, establishing Koeniggswerth Engineering as one of the few AG racing teams that could challenge the title."
global.team_lore[1,3] = "Thrilled by the success of the Jormungandr, founder Karl Gottlyeb-Daimar personally designed the Yggdrasil, but without reinventing the wheel. The base chassis structure and many other systems remain unaltered. What allows the Yggdrasil to achieve Class III specs is the extremely neat organization of its internal parts, which allows for extremely efficient injection and cooling. The cockpit was moved backwards, in a more protected position. The iconic two separate hulls were connected on the front through a lightweight support, making the ship more organic and even more resilient. Batteries were shielded, increasing isolation and efficiency. Last but not least, the engines were entirely redesigned to be bigger and more powerful. The Yggdrasil regularly won Survival races and obtained good results in other competitions too, but due to inexperience in the difficult Class III calendar and persisting weight issues, it didn't fully meet the over-inflated expectations of the public."
global.team_lore[1,4] = "The Odin was built based on the Yggdrasil, but its chassis was built with a whole new alloy type. The inherently sturdier material allowed the designers to maintain the legendary durability trademark of Koeniggswerth, stripping away lots of support elements in the ship's body, reducing weight and increasing performance. The characteristic glow of the energy battery rack, covered by additional plating in the Yggdrasil, has been put back on display on the left side. Engines were actually made smaller, but much more efficient. The original model of the Odin was created in 2512 and dominated between seasons 2516-17 and 2520-21. Racing in Class IV was much more dangerous at the time, and this ship had demonstrated that investing in durability was worth it. All other teams began looking more actively into protective plating and more resistant materials, making the introduction of the Odin a turning point in AG racing."
//Shulha AG
global.team_lore[2,0] = "The name Sulha AG Racing is rooted in history. It comes from an old Earth racing team, Sulha Racing, which was born as a joint israeli-palestinian project in 2028. This kind of collaborations were fostered and economically supported throughout by the two states, in order to promote stability and reduce cross-cultural barriers in a geographical zone torn by long years of conflict and finally entering a much needed era of peace. Sulha Racing was focused on rally. It competed in the last editions of the famous Dakar with good results, expanded its research department and moved in the field of vehicular activities on the Moon during the first colonization phase. The racing branch was disbanded during the Titan colonisation, when the company focused on producing vehicles for mass transit on the new planet. The company was eventually bought and absorbed. Sulha AG Racing was created as a joint-venture between Mars-based and Titan-based engineering companies. The name and the story behind it represent the intent of uniting different worlds, working together for success. Sulha AG entered the SRRL just a few years ago and grew quickly, becoming one of the top teams and pushing the boundaries of max speed and handling. Sulha AG hoverships are blazing fast. In fact, they are 80% engines and energy accumulators. Acceleration, speed and energy are a benchmark for the competition. Much less attention is given to the magnetic grip inducers, even less to the overall structure. For those drivers who are not afraid to take risks and respawn a few times during a race, pushing their driving skills to achieve the perfect trajectory without hitting too many barriers, this is the perfect team."
global.team_lore[2,1] = "The design principle behind the Qareen was basically 'attach two gigantic engines to a cockpit.' simply because the design team couldn't find a way to get rid of the cockpit. Each engine is completly autonomous and independent: it also contains its own energy turbine, battery accumulator, and fuel tank. Sulha even experimented with 3 engine blocks (the third one suspended on the central axis, beneath the others) before realizing that alignment, cooling and weight problems made this solution unviable. All controls for the pilot are duplicated: each engine and energy battery can be controlled autonomously. This makes driving the Qareen very different from other Redout ships. Pilots needed extensive training in order to be competitive, but the blazing fast speed of this ship made it competitive from day zero, since it was introduced in 2553."
global.team_lore[2,2] = "Bigger, badder, better. The structure of the Djinni is the same as the Qareen, but engineers worked on a number of elements to make it faster. Engines were made as big as Class II regulation would allow. Aerodynamic elements such as wind splitters and rear tails were enlarged, to better deal with the crazy air movements around the engines and the cockpit. Last, grip magnets were made redundant and more efficient, more in terms of energy consumption than grip force. The Djinni was produced in 2554, only one year after the Qareen was created, and has been competing at the top of the table ever since."
global.team_lore[2,3] = "The brilliant intuition behind the Class III Efreet concept, that would also drive the design of the Class IV Marid, was to move the energy turbines to the front. Coolant is injected from the back and the high-temperature combustion byproducts are immediately directed outside the engine body, through high-pressure pipes that discharge backwards. This allowed for much more efficient engine combustion, so much so that the Efreet prototypes had problems in containing their power. The most hilarious (albeit dangerous) incident happened in 2556, when two engines literally rocketed off the body, leaving the cockpit and the pilot behind on the track"
global.team_lore[2,4] = "The Marid was created in parallel with the Efreet. The new cooling design allowed Sulha to squeeze so much power out of their engines that it was easier to create a Class IV ship, rather than containing the power to remain withing Class III specs. Some attention was also given to magnetic stabilizers, re-engineering and relocating them: one on the inside, the bigger one on the outside of each engine. This allowed for more stability, although the team working on this part of the ship was quickly told to get back to work on engines and energy batteries. The two, tiny engines placed on the sides are actually highly-efficient miniaturized version of the main engines: they kick in automatically whenever they can for an extra boost, but quickly switch off due to absence of coolant. Sulha is still experimenting with multiple-engine solutions, dreaming one day of introducing a third engine in their design. Adding two minature extra engines is the closest they got to their goal."
//Conqueror Technologies
global.team_lore[3,0] = "The Conqueror Racing Team was born on the Moon. Created as a bet between two entrepreneurs originally from the us, it entered the Lunar Rally Championship without much hope, but ended up conquering the second overall place thanks to the driving performances of Colin Chee, a friend of the founder, who happened to be of native american origin. From that point, the company attracted good funding and was able to enter AG racing a few years later. All its ships have always been given a more or less romanticised versions of ancient indian names, as a good luck charm. Conqueror ships are not easy to tame. They are heavy, not too agile and not too brilliant in terms of sprint, but they are massively powerful: once they go up to speed, few are able to keep up the pace. They are sturdy and durable. Their batteries recharge really fast, although their capacity is limited: good drivers take advantage of this by using short bursts of turbo to compensate for the low acceleration."
global.team_lore[3,1] = "After the war, there was little interesting to do for those rich people who were not into investing in aerospace engineering or terraforming. A number of former financial brokers, landowners and retired politicians couldn't really keep up the pace with technological advancements and were not ready to invest in something they didn't understand. So they basically spent their days sitting on piles of money, unable to understand how to put them to work. The Gila was born on one of those gray days. The discussion started fighting over the fastest ancient car between the Ford Shelby GT500 Mustang and the 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat and slowly derailed towards betting on being able to create the fastest hovership ever created. Thomas Andreasen, former financial broker, founded Conquerer Technologies as a tribute to the old glories of the wheeled past. Formerly know as 'The Frontdiver,' the Gila has been renamed when Colin Chee joined the management team. Its outrageous design and total disregard for ideal weight is the result of Andreasen's unlimited passion for ancient American muscle cars."
global.team_lore[3,2] = "Even acknowledging the weak spots of the Gila, the team didn't want to iterate on the first ship to enhance it. The only common ground between the Gila and the Na'isha is the appearance: on the inside, the engine architecture was completely reimagined to gather additional power from the exhausts and the thrusters have been improved structurally to deliver more power in less space. The overheating problem was still there, and Chee settled for a design choice which pushed the engine even further, but constraining the battery capacity to the league minimum."
global.team_lore[3,3] = "The Na'isha gave the team the architectural design direction it needed to push the new hyperbolic rotator technology even further. Once the cooling system was moved to higher-order solitons, the same engine mounted on the Na'isha was allowed to compete in Class III races: the Ehawee was born. The team only had to accomodate space for it on the existing design and make the ship structure sturdier to support the new acceleration and lateral forces."
global.team_lore[3,4] = "The Li'ni' defined the state-of-the-art in muscle hoverships and broke all existing records in terms of top speed for each track in the SRRL. Incredibly, the engine is almost the same Class II engine found in the Na'isha (although completely exposed) and the cooling system comes from the Class III Ehawee, but the added thrusters managed to increase the overall performance of this ship by 30%, giving it a real edge against competitors. Built like an incremental upgrade from its two predecessors, the Li'ni' introduced one of the sturdiest metals found in the universe for its outer shell, again disregarding weight. The result is informally called 'the blazing-fast block of wood' as the Li'ni' handling is rather terrible, although it's capable of unmatched top speed."
//ASERA
global.team_lore[4,0] = "ASERA was born on the Earth as a joint-venture between japanese, taiwanese, vietnamese and korean engineering companies. Soon, they started a regular collaboration with the Asia-pacific Regional Space Agency in order to engineer terraforming-capable vehicles; the ASERA Engineering group entered production of sub-orbital recognition aircrafts later on. Much like ESA-AGR, space exploration spur the development of blazing-fast ag racing hoverships quite nicely. As a result, ASERA is a team with a long and honored tradition of cutting-edge research, always raising the bar in terms of innovation. When racing with this team, know that everything is focused on the energy pool. Making good use of powerups and the turbo is central to the driving approach."
global.team_lore[4,1] = "The Takatora is the second oldest ship design in the league, after the Vanguard. Presented in 2476, it soon began challenging ESA-AGR dominion over AG racing, thanks to its incredible use of extra energy. The gigantic, spherical battery at the core of the vehicle is the trademark of this team and was part of its vehicle design from very beginning. The peculiar shape of the cockpit support reduced visibility for the pilot, but granted extra protection from frontal impacts, frequent because of the terrible power of its Turbo Boost"
global.team_lore[4,2] = "ASERA didn't have financial problems, and the successes of the Takatora further increased their revenues. All this wealth allowed them to work on a Class II vehicle without pressure, carefully looking into the best possible solutions. The result is a show-off of technical prowess, a slender vehicle featuring an almost unprotected energy core in the middle, a single highly efficient central engine, and as many energy recovery systems as the technology of the time would allow. The Yoshihisa dominated Class II races from 2478-79 to 2482-83, also thanks to their research on the Repair Drone powerup. "
global.team_lore[4,3] = "The Yoshinobu was initially a flop. In the highly successful years of the Yoshihisa, a lot of effort went into studying alternative and often daring solutions, powerups, and additional systems. The engineering team lost sight of the basics, of what really makes an AG vehicle stand out, focusing instead on technicalities and engineering finesse. The Yoshinobu was presented in 2486 equipped with an EMP Blast, with the only goal of crushing the competition and especially Conqueror, who dared develop the Energy Drainer. The racing season was a disaster: the ship was not nearly as effective as it should have been and, despite Conqueror not taking part in the season, it got outclassed by ESA and Koeniggswerth. The project was revisited with renewed focus and determination, and the Yoshinobu quickly evolved into a terrific hivership, challenging the title already in 2488-89 and only losing by handful of points."
global.team_lore[4,4] = "The Nobunaga is the result of a continued research process started with the Yoshinobu. Having learned from previous mistakes, ASERA took plenty of time to carefully research and study their new vehicle, before entering the dangerous grounds of Class IV racing. The Nobunaga was presented in 2499, 12 years after the Yoshinobu. Its turbo boost was so powerful and the handling so well balanced that ASERA immediately won the title, despite the complete lack of experience in Class IV racing. "
//Lunare Scuderia 
global.team_lore[5,0] = "Lunare Scuderia is a contemporary racing team started by a group of former italian engineers, leftovers of every other luxury brand. Heritage of an entire dynasty of pilots, Lunare began racing in the 2548-49 season and was initially relegated to the last positions. The team has been steadily working its way up to the middle of the pack, up to thebrilliant victory of the 2554-55 season thanks to the exceptional driving of its two pilots Zanna and Zarandi and the unexpected performances derived by their nano-ceramicinjectors. That victory granted a much needed capital injection and the team was able to rack up more support thanks to commercial and sponsorships, making Lunare Scuderia able to regularly compete at the top of the table. Boasting the best acceleration available and a more than adequate top speed, matched by great handling, these ships sacrifice energy capacity and durability for the lightest possible structure."
global.team_lore[5,1] = "A quick design iteration over the blueprints of a dream car is what gave the Stradale its distinctive look and engine architecture. The Lunare engineers found out in 2545 how to coat their injectors with nano-ceramic tubes in order to cool the entire system down, but had to wait until the end of 2547 to find the capital needed to begin production. Being extremely tight on money at crucial point of production, the Scuderia decided to use the previous CEO car chassis as foundation for their first official racing ship. At its core, the Stradale is a reinforced street car on rockets. It comes at no surprise that the GT9 Stradale could barely score a handful of points in its first season: still, the story struck chord in the public and the team was able to gather additional funding."
global.team_lore[5,2] = "The Veloce has been the final masterpiece of Gianni Ricciardi, defunct CEO of Lunare Scuderia, three times winner of the Lunar Rally Championship, seven times winner of the Mars &amp; Titan Cronoscalata, before disappearing from the public radars. Produced with much less money constraints, the Veloce is the most lightweight AG ship ever made. Lunare expanded the nano-ceramic tubes to the entire structure, making twice as resilient and light compared to the GT9, and was able to work its way up to the top-half of the pack. "
global.team_lore[5,3] = "The GX210 marked a turning point for the Scuderia. Freed from the old engineering constraints and direction given by his father, Giuseppe Ricciardi worked on more than 500 prototypes before finding the correct combination of thrust and weight. The structure was designed to accommodate more powerful engines and resist to higher lateral G forces. Unfortunately, the Scuderia had to adapt the design to the new Class III restrictions introduced in 2550, disrupting the beautiful equilibrium of the entire ship"
global.team_lore[5,4] = "The GTX has been rebuilt from scratch four times by Lunare, one for each time the SRRL changed the specifications for the Class IV ships. While the other teams always managed to make small changes in the design to comply with the new regulations, Giuseppe was convinced that each time you rebuild something, you are making it better. And the Competizione is probably the only masterpiece he's happy to have left behind. Prefectly balanced and crazy fast, the Competizione is the best incarnation of the GTX and has won the SRRL with Zarandi four times in a row, starting 2554-55."
//Buran
global.team_lore[6,0] = "AG racing team BURAN is the new kid on the block. Founded in 2558 by Sveta Savitskaya and Taylor Wang, it inherits the name the first Soviet program for reusable spacecraft. Savitskaya and Wang met in 2542 while pursuing their doctorate in AG Superconductors at the Titan Physics University. After their groundbreaking research on the generation of AG fields, they started working for the racing division of ESA-AGR.  At the time, it was unthinkable that two engineers could leave the company to start their own and become a competitor in the same field. The two did exactly that, with their own private capitals. BURAN was born in 2557, entering the SRRL with their Class I Molniya. In an impressive debut season, BURAN ended up conquering the 3rd overall place. From there on, finding additional capital was not a problem. In a mere 3 years, BURAN was able to engineer AG ships for all racing classes and now consistently competes at the top. BURAN ships build up slowly and usually attack from the rear of the pack. As their acceleration and energy are sub-par, but their max speed is amongst the best of the league. Plus, their energy pool and boost power can compete with ASERA. Sturdiness is favored over maneuverability, which makes BURAN ships tough, blazing-fast rockets. In the hands of skilled pilots, these ships can be extremely competitive."
global.team_lore[6,1] = "The Molniya was designed completely by Savitskaya and Wang, the two BURAN founders. The aesthetics of the shop was inspired by the doodles that Wang used to draw while not studying Applied Physics at the Titan University. The 3 engines layout is a constant element for all BURAN ships. The massive central body offers plenty of space for a powerful soliton Engine, reliable AG magnets, and energy batteries. Structural supports that run for the entire length of the ship help increase durability. This is the first BURAN ship and its design didn’t change ever since. Its first season ended with a triumphant 3rd overall place, and unprecedented success for a debutant."
global.team_lore[6,2] = "The initial successes of the Molniya attracted lots of investment in the company. BURAN founders, who were used taking all matters in their own hands, were smart enough to start delegating work during the company expansion phase. Rather than controlling each and every aspect of design and production, they focused on hiring talented engineers they could trust, and let them do their job. The first result of this process was the Shtorm. The difference in design approach is particularly evident in the front of the ship, a cooling grid that distances itself quite a lot from the Molniya design. The height of the cockpit is another difference, as visibility in the Molniya was really limited. The body is even more massive, but aerodynamics had been improved overall. The ship performed well in its first season, confirming the value of the team by finishing 3rd place again."
global.team_lore[6,3] = "The Uragan was perhaps the least successful ship produced by BURAN. The chassis is the same used for the Shtorm, while a new super-light aluminum alloy was used for the lateral engines, which were build much bigger because of this. But the material offered less resistance to wear than initially predicted, causing the Uragan to retire multiple times due to engine faults. The material was perfected and the front part redesigned by Wang himself in 2559, with a peculiar four-pipes solution that convey cool air from the front grid to the back of the ship. The revisited Uragan is now ready to challenge the title."
global.team_lore[6,4] = "The layout for the Tayfun was designed by Savitskaya and Wang, who relished the challenge of building a Class IV racecraft. Right after completing the Molniya, they started working on the Tayfun for 3 months, joining forces with a dedicated engineering team and building a prototype within a year. The result is a racecraft with a slightly weird look. Detractors were quick to comment that the wo lateral supports were too wide, the flaps on the top were too tall, the rear engine didn’t offer enough power to justify its weight, and that cockpit visibility was back to being ridiculous, just like in the Molniya. But all critics were silenced as the Tayfun won its debug race, finishing 2nd in the league in 2559, its first season competing Class IV."
